This document is a vignette to demonstrate how one may retrieve data from an [API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces). In this tutorial, I will be interacting with Spoontacular's [food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs). I have created a few functions to interact with a few endpoints for user ease, and I'll use these to explore some of the data that was retrieved.
